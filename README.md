This landing page collects links to some things I worked on while at NIST between January 2015 and January 2025.

REFPROP things:
* [REFPROP-cmake](https://github.com/usnistgov/REFPROP-cmake) (CMake build tools to simplify building of REFPROP on all operating systems)
* [REFPROP-wrappers](https://github.com/usnistgov/REFPROP-wrappers) (Interfaces of NIST REFPROP for a wide range of computational environments, especially Python and Excel)
* [REFPROP-tests](https://github.com/usnistgov/REFPROP-tests) (Catch2 tests for NIST REFPROP, also regresssion testing, both native and docker-ized )
* [REFPROP-interop](https://github.com/ianhbell/REFPROP-interop) (Routines for converting NIST REFPROP file formats to those of teqp/CoolProp)

Thermodynamic things:
* [COSMO-SAC](https://github.com/usnistgov/COSMOSAC) (A reproducible implementation of the COSMO-SAC method)
* [teqp](https://github.com/usnistgov/teqp) (A new EOS implementation library with automatic differentiation) [![cibuildwheel](https://github.com/usnistgov/teqp/actions/workflows/build_cibuildwheel.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/usnistgov/teqp/actions/workflows/build_cibuildwheel.yml)
* [temo](https://github.com/usnistgov/temo) (Model optimization with teqp)
* [binfit](https://github.com/ianhbell/binfit) (Binary mixture interaction parameter fitting with deap)
* [potter](https://github.com/usnistgov/potter) (C++ and Python code for working with pair potentials and calculating virial coefficients) [see also https://www.etomica.org/apps/virial/]

Optimization-y things:
* [CEGO](https://github.com/usnistgov/CEGO) (C++ evolutionary optimization) [![cibuildwheel](https://github.com/usnistgov/CEGO/actions/workflows/build_cibuildwheel.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/usnistgov/CEGO/actions/workflows/build_cibuildwheel.yml)
* [NISTfit](https://github.com/usnistgov/NISTfit) (framework for model optimization in C++) [~obsolete]

Math-y things:
* [multicomplex](https://github.com/usnistgov/multicomplex) (multicomplex mathematics for very accurate derivatives)
[![build and run Catch tests](https://github.com/usnistgov/multicomplex/actions/workflows/runcatch.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/usnistgov/multicomplex/actions/workflows/runcatch.yml)
* [ChebTools](https://github.com/usnistgov/ChebTools) (tools for working with Chebyshev expansions in C++) [![Build](https://github.com/usnistgov/ChebTools/actions/workflows/build_wheels.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/usnistgov/ChebTools/actions/workflows/build_wheels.yml)
